# Shorty-URL

## About this repo
This is an API that converts a URL to a â€˜short linkâ€™ URL to send to friends. Additionally, it determines when and how many times the link was clicked. API can attempt to determine unique clicks using request metadata.
In the future, this should be able to be deployed in a production server so that you can send your friends links and prove that they really did open them. ðŸ˜¤

To run this locally, clone it and run `go run main.go`. Feel free to make use of the example requests posted in the [postman collection](./shorty_url.postman_collection.json).

#### \* This repo is a WIP and provided 'as-is' with no guarantee for support. You'll notice several TODOs scattered throughout the code. I didn't intend to post this code until it was complete, but here we are! Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
